	<div class="json">
		<h3>.JSON</h3>
		<p>
			The simple .json format allows for the entire file to be saved as a json string,
			aka. a format that can be almost universally opened by text editors and is
			very easy to implement into other projects.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="lvs">
		<h3>.LVS</h3>
		<p>
			LVS (Luca's Voxel storage) is a filetype designed to store voxel maps in an
			enhanced but more complicated way than .json. It is especially designed to work with
			software designed by me.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="png">
		<h3>.PNG</h3>
		<p>
			Originally designed to store images, it is also possible to encode json strings
			or other data to an image just for it to later be extracted back to a json string.
			Exporting a project to .png allows for more flexible sharing especially on
			image sharing websites.
