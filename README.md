## How to:
#### Online version
[Go to the full featured online version](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Quoteme/worldeditor/blob/master/index.html)

#### Local Installation
download the entire project into a new library and open index.html in your browser (chrome at best)
(note that the "dandelion.json" map requires you to first download the [dandelion resource pack for minecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/16x132-dandelion-cute-and-swirly/)
and extract the "/assets/minecraft/textures/blocks/" into the "resource/dandelion/" folder. This is only required if you want to see this specific demo demo)
